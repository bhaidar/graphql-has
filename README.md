**Why Highly Automated?**
---
**GraphQL and resolvers self-composition**

Both GraphQL definitions and resolving functions are written in the same file; if changes have been made, the GraphQL schema definition is generated during the bootstrap of the application by collecting all the "sub" definitions from those files; for the logic part, during this process all the resolvers are aggregated and registered to the Apollo GraphQL engine.
You are free to adopt your own approach to organize these files (further details below).

:blush: _Tip: If you want to execute this procedure manually, just run ```npm run prepare-graphql```_

**Easily configurable**

The application does support two configuration files, both located in the root directory.
The 'serviceconfig.custom.json' is obviously used for custom configurations; for accessing the configurations, the Conf class, under 'config/common.ts' can be used.

:blue_book: **Special case:** How to access configurations for remotes services

_Note: The helper will automatically derive the ENV to be used based on the given configuration._

```
// ...

import { getEndpoint } from '../../../config/apis';

// ...

const servUrl = getEndpoint('foobar-service');

// ...
```

**Tech. stack:**
---
1. Webpack 4 + TypeScript 3
2. Express 4 + ejs
3. Apollo Server 2
4. GraphQL 14
6. Lodash
7. Request Promise
5. NSP - Node Security Platform
6. PM2 ready
7. Docker ready

**Setup**
---
```
npm install
```

**First run after the setup**
---
If you are on production you just need to run the `npm run prod` command.

**GraphQL schema and resolvers self-composition**
---
As said before, during the bootstrap, the application is capable of self-composing the GraphQL definition and registering the resolvers by looking into the "resolvers" folder.
This allows the developer(s) to have everything as tight as possible, without spreading information over the solution.

**Resolvers and definitions: everything in one place**
---
Resolvers and definitions cohesists in the same file; these files are separated in contextual folders (mutations, queries, subscriptions, types) for the sake of order, though, you are free to rearrange them as you prefer (just remember to change the export in the index.ts file under 'resolvers').
You can also put queries, mutations, and different entities in general, in the same file if you prefer so.

**Single resolver**

**Multiple resolvers**

**Extending the GraphQL context**
---
In the GraphQL world, a context is an object(or function) called with the current request that creates the context shared across all resolvers.
Under the 'server/context' folder, there is the file that exports the custom context object where you can add the properties that your solution does need.

**Shaping and expanding the GraphQL response**
---
The GraphQL response can be re-shaped or expanded using a custom function returning the new response.
You can find it under 'server/extensions'.

**Adding GraphQL middlewares**
---
For the Express framework, middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.
Our custom middleware functions can be defined in the index.ts file under 'server/middlewares'.
Please note that it is an array of functions. :-)

**Working with custom validation rules**
---
The so called "validation rules" are additional GraphQL validations to be applied to client-specified queries. You can find the array containing them under 'server/validationRules'.

For further information (default rules already applied [https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/tree/master/src/validation/rules](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/tree/master/src/validation/rules)

**About autogenerated interfaces**
---
It is important, after having added or changed something to the GraphQL definitions, to generate the interfaces before using them in the custom classes.
To do so, the server can be manually run/restart right after it or using the wizard (```npm help```).

The application will expose two endpoints to download types and interfaces ( `{rest_endpoint}/types` and `{rest_endpoint}/interfaces` ).

You can also share these interfaces and fragments with UI WebApps.

**Run Builds**
---
```
npm run build:dev
```
```
npm run build:stage
```
```
npm run build:prod
```

**Run Application locally**
---
DEV env.:
```
npm run dev1
npm run dev2
npm run dev3
```

TEST env.:
```
npm run test1
npm run test2
npm run test3
```

PROD env.:
```
npm run prod
```

**GraphQL to TypeScript - autogenerate schema, types, fragments and TS interfaces**
---
```
npm run prepare-graphql
```

**Manual vulnerability check**
---
```
npm run check-vuln
```

**Run Tests**
---
```
npm run test
```

**Prod. PM2 first run**
---
```
npm run pm2:prod:first-run
```
Remember to run `pm2 save` to dump the processes list

**Manually install typings**
---
Even if deprecated, execute ```npm run install-typings``` to manually install typings

**Generate documentation**
---
```npm run docs``` to automatically generate documentation, ```npm run docs:clean``` to remove it
